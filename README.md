# mental-health-app-review
This repository was created on July 29, 2024, to save the codes and files supporting a Summer 2024 MSIT Capstone project at the University of Cincinnati to review Wysa chatbot reviews on the Apple App Store. Only a few codes and the files supporting the study are added to this repository. A thorough review of policies, the Terms of Service on the Apple App Store, and results from legal actions against scraping was conducted. Based on the information I found, a decision was taken to move forward with the app review because the purpose of this project was ethical and educational. The code was limited to only 200 reviews per year, 2022, 2023, and January - May 2024, the latter dates were decided due to the start time of the project.
